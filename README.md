## An app to make it easier to track/validate the play of a card game.

Left to do:
- See about getting it up and running in a phonegap app where one
  can scan barcodes on the backs of the cards instead of clicking
  the buttons.  This would allow for the app to track an actual
  physical game's progress and act as a kind of referee
- New game mode "validation only" which doesn't restrict play
  by cards in a hand (this would be the mode used by the phonegap
  app to validate an actual physical game)
- Game rules
  - Add more cards
  - Tweak number of cards per deck
  - Maybe start messing with other game components?
    - Meta-cards that don't take space in the stack but which
      have gameplay consequences (skip cards, wilds, no-ops, etc...)
